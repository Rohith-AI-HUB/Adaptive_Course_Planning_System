# Adaptive Course Planning System

## Overview
The **Adaptive Course Planning System** is an intelligent recommendation engine for university students. It combines three AI techniques:

1. **Fuzzy Logic** – classifies a student's academic profile (GPA, attendance, study effort, interest) into a qualitative type (Strong, Average, Weak).
2. **Neural‑Network Grade Predictor** – a TensorFlow model trained on a synthetic dataset that estimates the grade a student would obtain in a given subject.
3. **Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO)** – searches the space of possible subject combinations (respecting credit limits) to maximise the expected semester GPA while applying penalties for weak students on difficult courses.

The system can be accessed via a **Streamlit web UI** (`app.py`) or a **command‑line interface** (`main.py`).

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10** or newer
- `pip` (package installer for Python)
- (Optional) Git – to clone the repository

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven’t already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your‑org/adaptive‑course‑planning‑system.git
   cd adaptive-course-planning-system
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS / Linux
   ```
3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If `requirements.txt` is missing, the core dependencies are listed below.)

### Core Dependencies
| Package | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `streamlit` | Web UI (`app.py`)
| `tensorflow` | Neural‑network model loading/prediction
| `numpy` | Numerical calculations throughout the project
| `pandas` | CSV handling for dataset & subject list
| `scikit-learn` | Min‑Max scaling used by the predictor
| `matplotlib` *(optional)* | Plotting during model training (if you run `train_model.py`)
| `pytest` *(optional for testing)* | Running the test suite

---

## Quick Start
### 1. Generate the synthetic dataset (only needed once)
```bash
python generate_dataset.py
```
This creates `data/student_performance.csv` used for training the neural net.

### 2. Train the grade‑prediction model (optional – a pre‑trained model is already shipped)
```bash
python -m nn.train_model   # will read the CSV and produce model/grade_predictor.h5
```
If you modify the dataset, re‑run the training step.

### 3. Run the **CLI** version
```bash
python main.py
```
You will be prompted for:
- GPA (0‑10)
- Attendance (0‑100 %)
- Study effort (hours per week)
- Interest (0‑10)
The program prints the fuzzy classification, the recommended subjects, and the expected semester GPA.

### 4. Run the **Web UI**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the displayed localhost URL in a browser. The UI mirrors the CLI interaction but with sliders and a nicer presentation of the recommended subjects.

## Detailed Workflow
1. **User Input** – Four numeric indicators are collected.
2. **Fuzzy Classification** – `fuzzy.fuzzy_system.classify_student` maps the inputs to a qualitative student type.
3. **Subject Pool** – `data/subjects.csv` defines every possible course (name, credits, difficulty, type, etc.).
4. **Grade Prediction** – For any `(student_features, subject)` pair, `nn.predictor.predict_grade` loads `model/grade_predictor.h5` and returns a grade estimate (0‑10). The predictor internally scales inputs with a Min‑Max scaler derived from the training CSV.
5. **PSO Scheduler** – `optimization.pso_scheduler.run_pso` runs a particle‑swarm optimisation:
   - Each particle represents a set of 4 subject indices.
   - The fitness function averages the predicted grades, adds a penalty for *hard* subjects when the student is classified as **Weak**, and enforces a maximum credit limit of **18**.
   - The algorithm iterates (default 100 generations, 30 particles) and returns the best plan.
6. **Result Presentation** – Subject indices are translated back to human‑readable names via `subjects.csv`. The UI/CLI displays:
   - The fuzzy classification (`Strong` / `Average` / `Weak`).
   - Recommended subjects (name, credits, difficulty).
   - Expected semester GPA.
   - A short advisory sentence tailored to the student type.

## Testing
A few lightweight sanity‑check scripts are provided. They can be run directly or via `pytest`.
```bash
python test_fuzzy.py          # prints the fuzzy classification for a sample student
python test_prediction.py    # prints a grade prediction for a sample feature vector
python test_scheduler.py      # end‑to‑end run: classification → PSO → recommendation
```
If you have `pytest` installed, you can also execute:
```bash
pytest tests/   # (assuming the test files are placed under a tests/ folder)
```
All tests should complete without errors, confirming that the core pipeline works.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

### Suggested Areas for Extension
- **Real‑world dataset** – Replace the synthetic CSV with actual student performance data.
- **More sophisticated fuzzy rules** – Add additional linguistic variables (e.g., motivation, prior coursework).
- **Alternative optimisers** – Implement genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or mixed‑integer programming.
- **UI enhancements** – Display subject difficulty visualisations, export recommendations as PDF/CSV.
- **Model upgrades** – Experiment with deeper neural‑net architectures or gradient‑boosted trees.

When submitting a PR, please:
1. Follow the existing code style (PEP‑8, type hints where appropriate).
2. Add or update tests for new functionality.
3. Update this README if you add user‑facing features.
